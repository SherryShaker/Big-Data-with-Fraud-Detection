# Big-Data-with-Fraud-Detection

Credit fraud detection grows rapidly with the development of electronic payment. IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset was raised for technique innovation to tackle this problem. For the consideration of the size of the available fraud dataset, this project proposed a solution with the combination of the bigdata technique and the machine learning algorithms. Aside from the raised pipeline of the solution, other identified works include a comparision of four implemented machine learning algorithms, three surveys into the computing time with respect to the data size, number of executors and number of cores.
